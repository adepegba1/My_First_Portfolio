            <h3>Covid 19 Analysis</h3>
            <p>This project, <strong>Covid-19 Data Exploration</strong>, focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data
                using
                SQL queries to extract
                meaningful insights from a dataset stored in a relational database. A database named
                <code>covid_19</code> was created, and queries
                were executed to answer critical analytical questions such as identifying the total number of cases
                in
                each country,
                determining the dates of peak deaths in specific countries like Canada, and retrieving the highest
                smoothed new cases by
                country. The project also investigates demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as countries with
                the
                highest
                percentage of male smokers, African nations with the lowest GDP per capita, and vaccination rates
                across
                continents.
                Additional queries uncover yearly case trends, daily averages of deaths, infection rates relative to
                population, and
                continent-level comparisons of deaths. By combining aggregation, grouping, and ordering techniques,
                the
                project
                highlights patterns of spread, mortality, vaccination, and socioeconomic impact, offering a
                comprehensive exploration of
                the COVID-19 pandemic across countries and continents.

            <h3>Airline Database</h3>
            <p>This project involves designing and implementing a relational database system for a new airline
                company
                named
                <strong>AeroSpace</strong>, which aims to operate international flights. The database captures key
                business entities
                including
                <strong>Customers</strong>, <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Salaries</strong>,
                <strong>Planes</strong>, <strong>Flights</strong>, <strong>Statuses</strong>, and
                <strong>Accounting</strong>
                details. Each
                table is structured with appropriate primary and foreign key relationships to ensure referential
                integrity across the
                system. The database stores customer travel details, employee records, salary structures, plane
                conditions, flight
                schedules, operational statuses, and financial transactions to monitor profit or loss per flight.
                Additionally, it
                supports real-world airline operations such as salary adjustments due to inflation, assigning
                employees
                to flights,
                updating plane statuses, calculating revenue from cancelled flights, and retrieving insights such as
                customer
                demographics, flight punctuality, staff utilization, and income analysis. The system is robust
                enough to
                handle
                insertions, updates, and deletions, while also enabling analytical queries that aid in effective
                decision-making for
                AeroSpace's airline business operations.

            <h3>Netflix Database</h3>
            <p>This project explores the <strong>Netflix IMDB dataset</strong> using SQL to uncover insights about
                movies and TV shows available on
                the platform. The analysis focuses on identifying the top- and bottom-rated movies and shows based
                on
                IMDB scores,
                calculating average IMDB and TMDB scores across content types, countries, and age certifications,
                and
                examining content
                trends across decades. It also investigates the most common genres, age certifications, and the
                longest-running shows.
                Additionally, the project highlights the most frequent actors and directors, identifies highly rated
                and
                popular movies,
                and evaluates leading actors' performance based on average ratings. Overall, this project provides a
                comprehensive
                overview of Netflix content performance, trends, and key contributors using structured SQL queries.
